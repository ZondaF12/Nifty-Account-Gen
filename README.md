# Nifty-Account-Gen

EDIT: Since making the project the site has added cloudflare/bot protection so some features no longer work on this build

Create the Following Files in the directory:
- proxies.txt

Add profiles to the profiles.csv in email, password format. Catchalls can be used in the "random@catchall" format or use normal email addresses

Input API keys into the config file to allow the bot to solve captchas, as well as the 5sim API key if you intend to verify accounts
